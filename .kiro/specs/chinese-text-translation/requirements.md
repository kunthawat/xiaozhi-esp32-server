# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves translating all Chinese text content in the xiaozhi-esp32-server project to English. The project appears to be a voice assistant system with both backend (Java Spring Boot API, Python server) and frontend (Vue.js web interface) components. The translation should maintain technical accuracy while ensuring the system remains fully functional.

2. WHEN translating Chinese text THEN the system SHALL preserve technical terminology and maintain code functionality
3. WHEN translating user interface text THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent UI/UX terminology
4. WHEN translating documentation THEN the system SHALL preserve technical accuracy and context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the web interface, I want all Chinese UI elements translated to English so that I can navigate and use the system effectively.

3. WHEN reviewing database schemas THEN all table and column comments SHALL be in English
4. WHEN reading README files THEN all content SHALL be in English

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer extending the system, I want all code comments and variable names translated to English so that I can understand and modify the codebase effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading source code THEN all comments SHALL be in English
2. WHEN reviewing variable names THEN Chinese characters SHALL be replaced with English equivalents
3. WHEN examining function names THEN Chinese characters SHALL be replaced with English equivalents
4. WHEN viewing class names THEN Chinese characters SHALL be replaced with English equivalents

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the translation to maintain system functionality so that all features continue to work after translation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translating database content THEN all foreign key relationships SHALL remain intact
2. WHEN translating configuration values THEN all system integrations SHALL continue to function
3. WHEN translating API responses THEN all client applications SHALL continue to work
4. WHEN translating file paths and references THEN all internal links SHALL remain valid
